In order to map Land Cover/Land Use in french-Guyana (South-america), few scripts were developped or adapted to enable either semi-automaticaly mapping of 
LCLU (Sentinel 1, 2 and Landsat 8) either to explore cloudless mosaic and even automaticaly detect floodings with Sentinel 1 SAR data.

All This was developped with GEE Javasript Code Editor ( https://code.earthengine.google.com/ ). Once you have an Google account, you only 
have to subscrive to the service. Then copy/paste the code in the Code Editor and run it

This work takes place in the context of an internship of three months (fourth year of geography) in the french agriculture ministry that 
aimed at automaticaly and yearly spoting LCLU in the french region of Guiana (South America).

Don't be surprised that the scripts are loaded with French and English comments, it aims at allowing agents to get the best of it but also 
to keep it usefull for each and everyone interrested in working in such contexts.

By the way, i'd like to underline the Google Earth Engine developpers group for their conscious or even unconscious "commons" spirit.
